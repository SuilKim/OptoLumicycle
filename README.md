# OptoLumicycle
This code accompanies the Kim and McMahon manuscript submission <i>"Light sets the brainâ€™s daily clock by regional quickening and slowing of the molecular clockworks at dawn and dusk."</i> It allows for interfacing between the Lumicycle data collection program (Actimetrics) and a signal generator program so that a modified luminometer OptoLumicycle can employ <i> in situ</i> optogenetic stimulation of brain slices at various intervals while recording bioluminescence from the slices.

PMTON.m and PMTOFF.m are just for remotely turning on and off the Lumicycle photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). They are useful when samples are placed into or taken out of the Lumicycle.
Example sheet.xlsx is an example of a spreadsheet of individual stimulation times and it is plugged into OptoLumicycle.m script.
